      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>-I am an aspiring web developer who, although currently working in the restaurant industry, hope to completely shift my career path
        towards tech - which to many people seems crazy but to me its all about just learning new thing and seeing where things take you. 
      </p>
      <p>-I have been working in the restaurant industry for 5+ years working in all sorts of different roles - cooking, serving,
        maintenance, managing, bartending, bussing, and more. Its been a great experience but I have always wanted to make an impact 
        on the world and create new things that can benefit people and will be remembered even after I am gone. With the growth of tech,
        the possibilities are endless and now is the perfect time to jump in and leave a legacy.
      </p>
      <p>-I also have an interest in psychology and have almost completed an associates in Psychlogy at Las Positas Community College.</p>
